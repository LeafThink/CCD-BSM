# CCD-BSM
A brush stroke graphic generation model based on composite curves, which is used for robotic Chinese calligraphy.

# Data Available
All of data involved this work are collected using “AUBO-i5”robotic arm or generated by several methods implemented by us. The folder "samples of data" includes several samples of real stroke images written by robotic arm and the simulated images which are generated by different models or methods. The data for this project is only available for academic studies relevant to robotic Chinese calligraphy. Any one need our data should fill and sign the CCD-BSM Agreement and contact us with a reasonable request and declare that the data will never be used for any commercial aims. The data requirement with the agreement file could be sent to the email dmguo@aust.edu.cn or liang.ye@hotmail.com.
